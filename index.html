    <h1>Blob Fish</h1>
    <p><strong>The</strong> <em>BLOB FISH</em> is awesome because despite there apperance which makes them misunderstood they cam live for up to <em>130 YEARS.</em> <br>
      We dont know alot about this species since they live all the way at the bottom of the ocean making the ocean pressure nearly impossible for a humans to explore. Also just by looking at this blob fish how could you not love him. <strong></strong>.</p>
